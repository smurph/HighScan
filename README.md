# HighScan

Short for **High**sec **Scan**ner is a tool to assist Eve Online players with ship cargo scanning and appraisal. 

It watches the clipboard and will send anything with a newline to evepraisal.com to be appraised using Jita market value. If evepraisal returns a result, it will be displayed. You can also copy the evepraisal result URL with a button.
