# HighScan

Short for **High**sec **Scan**ner, HighScan is a tool to assist Eve Online players with ship cargo scanning and appraisal. 

Using this tool, you no longer need to keep your in game browser (or any other browser) open to evepraisal.com. And this tool removes the paste step in the cargo scanning process.

It works by watching the clipboard and will send anything with a newline to evepraisal.com to be appraised using Jita market value. If evepraisal returns a result, it will be displayed and you will be able to copy the evepraisal result URL with the click of a button.
